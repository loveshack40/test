            <h2>About Anhydrous Ammonia</h2>
            <p>
                Anhydrous ammonia, also known as ammonia gas, is a compound with the chemical formula NH3. It is commonly used as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture due to its high nitrogen content. Anhydrous ammonia is produced through a modified Haber–Bosch process and is typically injected under the soil surface. It rapidly dissolves in the soil solution, providing essential nitrogen nutrients to plants. One significant characteristic of anhydrous ammonia is its pungent odor, which can be detected even at low concentrations.

            <h2>Toxicity</h2>
            <p>
                Despite its importance in plant nutrition, anhydrous ammonia can be toxic to plants at higher concentrations. Higher levels of ammonium ions, compared to other nitrogen species in fertilizers, can inhibit plant growth. This phenomenon, known as ammonium toxicity, was first demonstrated by Charles Darwin in 1882.

        <section id="exposure">
            <h2>Exposure</h2>
            <p>
                Exposure to anhydrous ammonia primarily occurs in agricultural settings during its application as a fertilizer. Individuals working in agriculture, such as farmers and agricultural workers, are at risk of exposure. Additionally, people living in proximity to agricultural areas where anhydrous ammonia is used may also be exposed to the compound.

        <section id="health-effects">
            <h2>Health Effects</h2>
            <p>
                In humans, exposure to anhydrous ammonia can lead to severe health effects, particularly affecting the respiratory and nervous systems. Inhalation of high concentrations of ammonia gas can cause irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Prolonged exposure or exposure to higher concentrations can result in lung damage and respiratory distress. Furthermore, ammonia can also affect the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and nausea. In extreme cases, exposure to high levels of ammonia can result in coma or even death.

            <h2>Research Paper</h2>
            <p>
                The selected research paper titled "Overcoming Ammonium Toxicity" investigates the mechanisms underlying ammonium toxicity in plants and explores strategies to mitigate its adverse effects. The study utilized publicly available information on biochemical metabolites, pathways, and reactions in plant metabolic and genetic databases. By examining the balance between uptake, production, and detoxification of ammonia in crops and weeds under different conditions, the research aims to provide insights into reducing or eliminating ammonium phytotoxicity.
